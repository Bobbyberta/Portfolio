                    <p class="lead">
                        In 2019, I led the design and development of "Bubble Function," an educational math game that 
                        would go on to be shortlisted for a TIGA award. This is the story of how we created a game 
                        that made function machines fun and accessible for young learners.
                    </p>

                    </div>

                    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                    <p>
                        When Mangahigh approached me about creating a replacement for their Algebra Meltdown game, 
                        I knew we had a significant challenge ahead. The original game had been a cornerstone of 
                        their function machine learning content, but user feedback indicated that while the core 
                        concept was solid, the difficulty curve was too steep for many students.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Initial Research</h2>
                    <p>
                        Our first step was to conduct thorough research with both teachers and students. We discovered that:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Students found the abstract nature of function machines challenging</li>
                        <li>Visual representation helped with understanding</li>
                        <li>Quick feedback loops were essential for learning</li>
                        <li>The game needed to support different learning speeds</li>
                    </ul>

                    <div class="blog-image">
                        <img src="../../images/bubble-function-sketch.jpeg" alt="Early design sketches of Bubble Function" loading="lazy">
                    </div>

                    <h2>The Design Process</h2>
                    <p>
                        We began with paper prototypes, testing different game mechanics that could make function 
                        machines more intuitive. The breakthrough came when we combined the concept with a bubble 
                        shooter mechanic - it provided a natural way to visualize input and output values while 
                        keeping the game engaging.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Key Design Decisions</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Visual Function Machines: Made the abstract concrete</li>
                        <li>Progressive Difficulty: Gentle learning curve with optional challenges</li>
                        <li>Immediate Feedback: Clear visual and audio cues for correct/incorrect answers</li>
                        <li>Multiple Solution Paths: Supporting different problem-solving approaches</li>
                    </ul>

                    </div>

                    <h2>Technical Implementation</h2>
                    <p>
                        We built Bubble Function using HTML5 and the Phaser game engine, ensuring it would work 
                        across different devices and platforms. The technical challenges included:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Creating smooth animations that helped visualize the math concepts</li>
                        <li>Implementing precise collision detection for the bubbles</li>
                        <li>Optimizing performance for weaker devices</li>
                        <li>Ensuring consistent behavior across different screen sizes</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Impact and Results</h2>
                    <p>
                        The game was well-received by both teachers and students:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>TIGA Award shortlist for Best Educational Game</li>
                        <li>Increased student engagement with function machine concepts</li>
                        <li>Positive feedback from teachers about improved understanding</li>
                        <li>Successfully replaced the original game in Mangahigh's curriculum</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
                    <p>
                        This project reinforced several key principles of educational game design:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Start with the learning objectives, then build the fun around them</li>
                        <li>Regular testing with the target audience is crucial</li>
                        <li>Visual feedback helps cement mathematical concepts</li>
                        <li>Balance is everything - too easy is boring, too hard is frustrating</li>
                    </ul>
