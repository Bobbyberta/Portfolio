                                        <h4>A New Challenge for Teachers</h4>
                                        <p>
                                            For years, Mangahigh had been a trusted name in math education, known for turning complex 
                                            concepts into games that kids loved to play. But coding was a whole new ballgame. Unlike math, 
                                            where well-established teaching methods existed, the coding curriculum was uncharted territory.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Teachers were often unequipped to teach the subject, let alone guide students from following 
                                            instructions to coding independently. This wasn't just a gap; it was a chasm. Our goal was to 
                                            build a bridge—not just for students but for the teachers who would be their guides.
                                        </p>
                                    </div>

                                            The project came with a distinct advantage: Mangahigh's existing platform. With its personalized 
                                            dashboards, leaderboards, and gamified learning, we had a proven foundation to build on. The 
                                            question was, how do we translate the excitement and structure of math education into a completely 
                                            new subject?
                                        </p>

                                            Enter our curriculum expert, a veteran who had helped shape the UK's National Curriculum. With 
                                            their expertise and Mangahigh's established platform, we had the tools to craft something unique. 
                                            All we needed was a clear plan—and a lot of creativity.

                                            With the research in place, the real design work began. The platform's constraints—limited input 
                                            types and minimal graphics—meant we had to be strategic. Questions needed to be simple yet 
                                            effective, visually engaging without overwhelming.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            One example was a map-based direction question. The first iteration was ambitious, but we quickly 
                                            realized it needed to be scaled back to fit the platform's capabilities. The second iteration 
                                            balanced creativity with practicality, and the result was a seamless interaction that aligned 
                                            with our goals.

                                            Designing the coding product was as much about collaboration as it was about creativity. From 
                                            process diagrams that outlined every stage to countless feedback sessions, it was a team effort 
                                            at every step. My role extended beyond design—I created illustrations, co-wrote questions, and 
                                            worked closely with the curriculum expert to ensure every piece fit into the bigger picture.

                                    In January 2019, we launched the first version of Mangahigh's coding product at the BETT education 
                                    conference. While this version wasn't a fully realized educational product, it was a vital first step. 
                                    It demonstrated what was possible and laid the groundwork for future iterations.
                                </p>

                            <div class="conclusion-card">
                                <h2>Looking Forward</h2>
                                <p>
                                    The journey didn't end with the launch. The lessons learned during this project continue to shape how 
                                    we approach education at Mangahigh. As coding becomes an increasingly vital skill, we're proud to have 
                                    taken an early step in making it accessible to learners everywhere.
