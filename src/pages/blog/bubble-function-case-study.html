                <p>
                    In 2019, I led the design and development of "Bubble Function," an educational math game for 9-12-year-olds. 
                    This project was born from a need to replace Mangahigh's discontinued "Algebra Meltdown," a game that, 
                    while popular, was deemed too challenging for its target audience.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Mangahigh, an online learning platform, sought a new game to engage young learners and help them grasp 
                    the concept of function machines. After careful consideration of user feedback, we decided to focus on 
                    the function machine element and simplify the overall gameplay.
                </p>

                <h2>The Design Process</h2>
                <p>
                    My design process began with extensive research and ideation. I explored various concepts, eventually 
                    settling on a unique blend of function machines and the classic bubble shooter mechanic. This innovative 
                    approach aimed to make learning both fun and intuitive.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Paper prototyping played a crucial role in early development. I sketched out puzzle levels and tested 
                    them with colleagues to gauge their playability and gather initial feedback. This iterative process 
                    ensured that the core gameplay mechanics were engaging and accessible.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Building upon the core gameplay, I created a comprehensive game design document (GDD). This document 
                    served as a blueprint for the development team, outlining all game features, mechanics, and design 
                    specifications.
                </p>

                <h2>Development and Testing</h2>
                <p>
                    The development phase involved close collaboration with a cross-functional team, including in-house 
                    and remote developers, a remote artist/animator, and a dedicated games designer. We followed an agile 
                    development methodology, ensuring flexibility and rapid iteration.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Throughout the development cycle, rigorous testing was conducted. I personally led in-school testing 
                    sessions with a diverse group of students, observing their gameplay and gathering valuable feedback. 
                    This invaluable input allowed us to fine-tune the game's difficulty, improve the user interface, and 
                    address any potential challenges.
                </p>

                <h2>Release and Beyond</h2>
                <p>
                    After a successful development phase, "Bubble Function" was launched on the Mangahigh platform. The 
                    game received positive feedback and has since been enjoyed by countless students.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Even after the initial release, I continued to support the project, ensuring a smooth handover to the 
                    team responsible for ongoing development and maintenance.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Bubble Function" is a testament to the power of collaborative design, user-centered development, and 
                    a commitment to creating engaging and effective learning experiences.
                </p>
